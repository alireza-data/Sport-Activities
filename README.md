🏃‍♂️🏊‍♀️ Fitness Data Analysis: Running & Swimming

This repository contains Python scripts & notebooks for analyzing my fitness data. Dive into running, walking, and swimming activities to track performance, efficiency, and training trends over time. 📊✨

🚀 Features
🏃 Running & Walking
📈 Performance Progression: Track pace, distance, and heart rate trends over time.
🍫 Effort vs Reward: Analyze calories burned per minute and workout efficiency.
🧭 Walking Fingerprint: Radar charts of steps, moving time, laps, and pace per month/year.
👣 Steps Analysis: Histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots for steps, lap times, and consistency.
⏱️ Time Comparison: Moving vs elapsed time to spot idle periods during walks/runs.

🏊 Swimming
📊 Performance Over Time: Line charts of pace, distance, and session volume.
💪 Stroke Efficiency: Analyze strokes per distance, Swolf, and stroke rate trends.
🏁 Lap Analysis: Boxplots & bar charts for best lap times and pacing.
🔥 Calories & Workload: Compare session calories, distance, and time to see intensity.
🌙 Idle vs Moving Time: Visualize rest periods during swims.
🎯 Swim Fingerprint: Radar charts comparing distance, strokes, Swolf, and stroke rate across months or years.
🧠 Correlation & Efficiency: Heatmaps & scatter plots to find what drives faster, more efficient swimming.

⚙️ Technical Details
📂 Data Input: CSV exports from Garmin with columns like Date, Distance, Time, Calories, Avg Pace, Best Pace, Total Strokes, Avg. Swolf, Stroke Rate.
📚 Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (clustering), plotly (interactive).
🔢 Normalization & Aggregation: Metrics normalized for radar charts; monthly/yearly aggregates and rolling averages for trends.
🎨 Visualizations: Line charts, bar charts, histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, radar charts, and heatmaps.

🎯 Purpose
Track long-term performance improvements in swimming & running.
Understand training efficiency & effort vs output.
Detect fatigue, overtraining, and idle times.
Create an artistic & analytical “fitness fingerprint” for personal tracking. 🏅
